+ About me: Mario Muscarella is a microbial ecologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. His research investigates how environmental changes affect the structure and function of microbial communities in natural and host ecosystems, particularly in Arctic and boreal ecosystems. The Muscarella Lab conducts field observations, molecular and culture-based experiments, and applies ecological theory to understand microbial ecophysiology, biodiversity, and ecosystem functions. His team has studied how microbial communities respond to changing resource inputs, energy limitations, and ecosystem disturbances such as permafrost thaw and wildfires. In addition to using multi-omics techniques, the Muscarella Lab uses both laboratory and field methods to measure process rates and physiological responses. The lab also cultivates environmental isolates to examine their physiology through controlled experiments aimed at gaining a mechanistic understanding of observed responses. The research from the Muscarella Lab enhances understanding of how microbial processes influence carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions under various environmental change scenarios, providing crucial insights that enhance climate models and inform ecosystem management strategies.
